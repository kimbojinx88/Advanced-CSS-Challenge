# Advanced-CSS-Challenge
The objective of this project was to create a working portfolio to showcase my accumulated skills and abilities to work with CSS and flexbox in creating an adaptive and responsive webpage. 

I applied flex properties to the URL links in my page as well as the placeholder images that I sourced from the from challenge 17 Ins_CSS-box-model challenge from the class repository. I also took information I learned from Stackoverflow in order to help set the parameters for my links at the top of the page. I also used information from W3Schools as well as referred back to the class repository in order to format my profile picture for my portfolio.
